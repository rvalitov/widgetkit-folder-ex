# Overview
**FolderEx** is a Content Provider plugin for [Yootheme Widgetkit2](https://yootheme.com/widgetkit). It's a superior version of a standard Folder Content Provider that allows to use files as items for a widget. After installation it becomes available for any standard or custom widgets. Especially the FolderEx is optimal for use with image related widgets, for example:

* Standard Widgets
	* [Gallery Widget](http://yootheme.com/demo/widgetkit/joomla/index.php/home/gallery)
	* [Slideshow Widget](http://yootheme.com/demo/widgetkit/joomla/index.php/home/slideshow)
	* [Slideset Widget](http://yootheme.com/demo/widgetkit/joomla/index.php/home/slideset)
* Our custom Extended Widgets 
	* [SlideshowEx Widget](https://github.com/rvalitov/widgetkit-slidesetlightbox)
	* [Slideset Lightbox Widget](https://github.com/rvalitov/widgetkit-slidesetlightbox)

## Features
For detailed information, please refer to the [manual](https://github.com/rvalitov/widgetkit-folder-ex/wiki). Quick comparison between Folder and FolderEx is [here](https://github.com/rvalitov/widgetkit-folder-ex/wiki/Quick-comparison-Folder-VS-FolderEx).

### Basic Features

* **Select a source folder** - it's a directory that contains files that will be used as a source for content items of a widget.
* **Ordering options** - the files can be sorted in direct and reverse order alphabetically, by modification date and randomly.
* **Limit number of items** - the maximum number of files that will be loaded can be limited.
* **Backward compatibility** - all other behavior, styling and features of the original Folder Content Provider are preserved.
* **Use with your existing data** - you can easily convert your existing widgets to use FolderEx as a content provider.

### Unique Features
The new features that the FolderEx has and that are not available in the original Folder Content Provider:
 
* **Sophisticated Filtering** - complete freedom to apply any filtering of files using RegExp patterns, [read more](https://github.com/rvalitov/widgetkit-folder-ex/wiki/Filtering-Patterns).
* **Better control of titles** - more options are available to control how the titles are created from the file names, e.g. replacement of dashes and/or underscores into space character.
* **Non Latin characters in file names** - you can name the files as you want in your native language, using non Latin characters, e.g. accents or Cyrillic characters. For example: `équipe.jpg`, `Животное.jpg`, `Übergabe.jpg`.
* **Tooltips for all options** - it's much easier to use the widget, because tooltips are available for all settings.
* **Update notifications** - you will be notified if new versions of the plugin are available.
* **Multilingual support**, translated into languages:
	* English (en_GB)
	* Русский (ru_RU)
	* Deutsch (de_DE)
